Yo! This is Vellichor. Or host and the body are 27, so I guess you could say we're old farts.

First, let's get this out of the way, because it WILL come up:

Yes, we're a traumagenic and medically recognized system, but we ARE absolutely endo-friendly.
The only condition is that you be sincere and respect the boundaries of DID/OSDD-specific spaces or resources.
In other words, if you're not barging into a DID support forum to discuss tulpamancy where it isn't appropriate,
you're probably doing perfectly fine and we're not interested in getting on you about the specifics about how or why you exist.
It literally is not our fucking business.

Despite some of the weird shit Ponytown denizens get on, the host has a background in psychology. As a result, we understand that
brains are weird, and these things are simply not fully understood by science - it's possible they never will be, in fact.
It was only a few decades ago we quite literally had people in cages writhing in their own feces because mental health care and
understanding were so abysmal; I highly doubt we've unlocked every secret to multiplicity/plurality/whatever you wish to call it
in that time, and even if we did, I don't exactly trust this field's track record of under-diagnosing (especially in POC and other
marginalized communities) of various mental health conditions, and the shoddy treatment it has a history of putting out.

We also recognize that cultural and spiritual plurality do exist - suggesting endogenics can't exist cannot be seaparated from
disregarding the importance of these experiences in various cultures. This would be flat out colonizer bullshit, so we have no
desire to partake in that behavior. We're not about any white privilege-influenced approaches to  understanding the complexities
of the brain.

Lastly (for the sake of brevity, anyway) we understand that the labels someone uses to describe their experiences is a very personal
decision, and we're not comfortable forcing someone to refer to themselves in medical terms if they don't wish to, or if they don't
currently see/recognize/rememeber their origins. There are systems out there that refer to themselves as endogenic for any of a million
reasons, and it's not our responsibility to force them to use a label that makes them uneasy or that they feel doesn't adequately
describe the extent of their experiences.

In short, if you are a decent person(s), we DO NOT care if you're endo, traumagenic, mixed-origin etc. We just care that you're
as kind and considerate as possible. That said, we prefer anti-endos to leave us alone, because association with you will compromise
the safety of the people we interact with who may have reasons beyond your awareness for choosing not to label themselves the way you do.
