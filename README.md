The Doctor | they/he/it | Adult

Plural, otherkin, fictionkin, furry.

Not a big talker, more of a people watcher and occasional jokester. I don't roleplay or anything. Love to make fan ponies tho!

I'm a spiritual otherkin and don't really vibe with the "kinning for fun" crowd. You do you, but I'm pretty serious serious my identity and we probably won't have a lot in common. It's not really fun for me. Species dysphoria and nightmares and whatnot.

I am plural. Our origins are our business and our business alone. We refuse to engage in syscourse or with people who waste their time and energy on it. You'd do well to do the same. Your mental health will thank you. So will everyone else's.

All that aside, I'm friendly, just pretty quiet. Have a great day!
